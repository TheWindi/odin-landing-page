        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This website was created as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project.</p>
        <p>The goal is to get familiar with a basic HTML and CSS structure with a focus on designing a layout with flexbox.</p>
        <p>If you actually want to Sign Up, thank you! But this is just for practice. So as of now the pictures on this website are all you're going to get.</p>
